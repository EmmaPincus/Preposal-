# Preposal-

For the final project I was thinking about making the game battleship.
I would use turtles to mark where the ships are and would use a picture of water or something for the background image.
I don't know how to update the turtle window when the user inputs something. Still thinking about how I can update the screen with the "ships".
If this is too ambitious I might go with a Minecraft choice game or something like that.
